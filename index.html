          <h3>The Knack with a Minor in Mathematics</h3>
          <p>I have the knack... for technology. My mom says I always have. She's worried I'm not like other kids. Yesterday, she left me alone for a minute and I disassembled the TV, clock, and the stereo. The part that worries her is I used the components to build a ham radio set... It's worse than the doctor feared. He's afraid I have the knack. It's a rare condition characterized by an extreme intuition of all things mechanical and electrical... and utter social ineptitude. Can I lead a normal life? No, I'll be an engineer.</p>

          <h3>1999 Genetic Lottery Winner</h3>
          <p>I was not only cursed with the knack but blessed with luck in the 1999 Genetic Lottery. It was just by chance that I formed into an extremely aesthetic human. As a stripper post pandemic, I feel blessed and in debt to Yung Cece for saving up the Ass Cash Stash. Most of the Ass Cash Stash has been thrown into Crypto which leads to the next skill I bring to the table.</p>

        <h3>Obsessive Passion for the Future of the Blockchain</h3>
        <p>I only started to learn about technology and the blockchain to impress my ex boyfriend. But turns out I'm actually super into it. John, if you ever see this, I hope you know you were really onto something. I will never forget the time I went comatose for a couple hours after trying to wrap my head around the concept of a CryptoKitty. Not only do I get it now, I'm obsessed with it. I will follow the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) till I die, just like CLE.</p>
